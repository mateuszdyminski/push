* Push feature in HTTP/2

HTTP/2 Push allows a web server to send resources to a web browser before the browser gets to request them. It is, for the most part, a performance technique that can help some websites load faster.

HTTP/2 Push[1] is not a mechanism for the server to notify things to the browser. Instead, pushed contents are used by the browser when it may have otherwise produced a request to get the resource anyway. But if the browser does not request the resource, the pushed contents become wasted bandwidth.

* Push feature in Golang

If a web server supports HTTP/2, the http.ResponseWriter implements the new http.Pusher interface.

Handlers can use its functionality to trigger a Server Push for a resource by providing an HTTP method, path, and request headers.

This request is created "by hand" and is served by the registered handler of the http.Server that served the original request.
